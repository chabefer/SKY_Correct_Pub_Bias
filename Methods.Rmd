You can find an extensive discussion of the methods used to correct for publication bias in the collaborative book [Statistical Tools of Causal Inference](https://chabefer.github.io/STCI/sec-meta.html#publication-bias-and-site-selection-bias).

The methods we want to test in this project are:

  * FAT-PET-PEESE, in three versions (Fixed effects, random effects and weighted least squares).
  * p-curving.
  * Selection models (in their Andrews and Kasy version).
